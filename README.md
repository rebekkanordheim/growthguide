## Description

This was the last big exam in my first year as a front end development student. The task was to make a website, a blog, where i could choos the theme and the "customer" myself. So I decided to make a blog which writes about different themes so that people could read the posts, and use it as a guide for growing and becoming a better and stronger person. 

The thing i find very fun in this exam is that I can make everything myself, from making the logo, deciding the colors and the design on the whole page.

The big difference in this task is that I have made a carousel on the home-page, which is showing different images and read-more buttons, which are linking to different blog posts. These blog posts aren't hard-coded but are fetched from an API on rebekkanordheim.no 

## Built With

- Figma (for design)
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript for fetching API and making a carousel.

This is all that you need to start this simle website.
